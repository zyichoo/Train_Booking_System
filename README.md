  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of my academic coursework, my teammate and I developed a Train Booking System using Visual Studio 2022. The system features four key modules: Admin, Passenger, Train Booking, and Payment. While the project was not fully completed, it strengthened my skills in application development, system design, and collaboration.

This figure illustrates a block diagram of our entire system, outlining the critical functions and their interconnected relationships. These core functionalities are represented by various blocks and linked by arrows, providing a clear understanding of the flow and interdependence of the modules.<br> 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon initiating access to the system, users can log in with their pre-established accounts. Depending on the role associated with their credentials—be it an admin, or a passenger—the system directs them to the appropriate dashboard. Notably, both successful user and admin logins lead to the Train Booking Page, serving as a central hub for further interactions.<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Users, including administrators, are directed to the Train Booking Page once they have been authenticated. They proceed through the train booking process, beginning with selecting their origin and destination and ending with specifying travel dates. Firebase dynamically populates train stops, ensuring that only the most recent options are available. Following the selection process, the system displays available trains based on user criteria using Firebase. Following selection, users proceed to the Seat Selection Page, where they select seats based on the number of passengers. After they've made their selections, they'll be taken to the Passenger Details Page to enter their personal information.<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent to the Passenger Details Page, users enter the payment phase. Here, a summary of their booking details is presented, providing a chance for review. The system simulates a successful payment experience, and upon completion, the booking details are stored securely in the database.
